  # between the Ruby and JAppOpticsAPM instrumentation under JRuby.

  # This is because that even though there may be an incoming
  # X-Trace request header, tracing may have already been started
  # by Joboe.  Such a scenario occurs when the application is being
  # hosted by a Java container (such as Tomcat or Glassfish) and
  # AppOpticsAPM has already initiated tracing.  In this case, we shouldn't
  # pickup the X-Trace context in the X-Trace header and we shouldn't
  # set the outgoing response X-Trace header or clear context.
  # Yeah I know.  Yuck.
